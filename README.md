wj (work journal)
=================

wj is a python script to help track your progress on all work projects.

It is meant as a thin layer on top of a brief text-based journal.

The primary objective is to make it easy to see at a glance what I
have been working on lately.  The long-term vision is to produce
a single page, year-long summary consisting of 52 sentences, one
per week.

The motivation for this is to give me a bird's eye view of my
own progress that is hard to see on a daily basis.  It's nice
to gain perspective on where I'm gaining or losing momentum,
as well as to keep an eye out for lower priority projects that
are eating up too much time.
